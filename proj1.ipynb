The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

    "Each record represents a resturant in the area of SF that includes data for business id, name, address, city, state, postal code, latitude, longitude, phonenumber. The primary key is business_id. When using groupby('business_id'), it shows a data frame that is grouped by business id or indexed at business_id. When using groupby('name'), it creates a data frame that is indexed at name. Using groupby('address'), it also returns a dataframe that is indexed at address. For grouping by business_id, since each business id is unique, you get a similiar dataframe as in bus but with the index at business_id. But for the other two, you get different dataframe with a smaller size. "

    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",

    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",

The anamolous values seem to be scores that are are in the lower end of the spectrum because it seems that most resturants are able to get scores over 92. The mean is around 90. The unusual feature is how so many resturants are able to get such high scores with a score of 100 having the most counts. My observation imply that its easy to get a high score and hard to get a score less than 92. Resturants are trying to be in their best condition all year round so that they don't fail their inspection. Depending on each resturant's score, it can affect the business. "
